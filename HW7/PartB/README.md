This repository walksthrough on how Vertex AI can be used to create complete End-End MLOps pipeline.

1. [Part A](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_a.docx): Outlines how to create and submit a ML pipeline with Vertex Pipelines. Create a pipelines that deploys an AutoML classification model.
Schedule a pipeline job with Cloud Scheduler 

2. [Part B](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_b.docx): Creating a fraud detection model using Vertex AI. Create a managed dataset and upload to Vertex AI. Deploy model to endpoint and get predictin from that endpoint.
   
3. [Part C](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_c.docx): Outlines how to use Vertex AI to train and serve a TensorFlow model using code in a custom container. The steps for custom training job in Vertex AI and predicitng from that.

4. [Part E](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_e.docx): Outlines creating managed datasets and custom model for training a Scikit Learn model. Finally deploy the trained model and get online predictions. The dataset used for this demo was the Titanic Dataset.


5. [Part F](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_f.docx): Outlines configuring and launching a hyperparameter tuning job from Vertex AI UI.

6. [Part G](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_g.docx): Outlines how to canalyze metadata from your Vertex Pipelines. Write custom pipeline components that generate artifacts and metadata. Compare Vertex Pipelines runs, both in the Cloud console and programmatically. Trace the lineage for pipeline-generated artifacts Query your pipeline run metadata. Query pipeline run metadata

7. [Part H](https://github.com/surabhigovil/Emerging-Technologies-in-ML-Fall-2021-Assignments/blob/main/HW7/PartB/part_h.docx): Outlines how to build AutoML Forecasting Model with Vertex AI using options such as a budget and optimization objective.
