This folder contains DeepMind's Perciever and Perciever IO models explored in detail. Perciever model is trained for image classification task. Keras has been used to implement Perciever model.

Perciever Input:

Perciever Output:

Perceiver IO which is a generalization of Perceiver as in that it can take any arbitrary inputs and produce outputs has been trained for a video flow task. Here trained Perciever IO for creating an optical flow from video.

The code has been adapted from the following refenrces:
