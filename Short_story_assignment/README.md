# Survey of AutoGL for Graph Learning problems in Machine Learning. 

## The learning are based on the paper [AUTOGL: A LIBRARY FOR AUTOMATED GRAPH LEARNING] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04987v2.pdf)

The paper elborates how AutoGL the first dedicated framework for machine learning on Graph data can make the task of feature engineering, data download and mangement, model building and training and hyperparameter optimization faster. The researchers have immaculately outlined how AutoGL fares well over AutoML libraries like Hypereparameter Optimization (HPO) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in terms of scalibility and flexibility.
